Trip Current

	P = 5kW
	Vnominal = 117.6 - 155.4 - 176.4 V
	Itrip = 42.5 - 32.1 - 28.3 A

	at 28.3 amps
		output = 2.60V

	P = VI
	I = P/V

15kW per motor

250 I max
	
Brake range 0.5 to 4.5
	realistic output 0.5 to 

will need molex connector

Include schematic of BSPD.  Clearly show current sensor input, brake input and shutdown circuit output.  Be sure schematic includes details addressing latching and timing.
