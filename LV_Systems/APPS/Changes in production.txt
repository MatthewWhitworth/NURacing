Check gain
	new gain values appear to have solved problem, diff resistors are significantly larger than
	sensor resistors. sim and testing proves this to work.

Check fault condition operating as intended

Time delay wrong
	Problem: decay of capacitor inaccurate at low voltage(0.45), adjusted comparator to switch at 2.5 V, more predictable.
